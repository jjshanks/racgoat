## 🦝🐐 RacGoat: AI Code Review TUI

**Built 100% with Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Claude Code**

> *"In code we trust, in raccoons we debug, in goats we climb."*

### The Problem

AI generates code fast. Too fast. Reviewing a 10,000-line diff from Claude Code in GitHub's UI? Painful. Pasting scattered comments back into Claude? Even worse.

### The Solution

A terminal UI that turns diff review into a conversation loop:

```bash
git diff | racgoat -o review.md
# Review → Comment → Press 'q'
# Paste @review.md into Claude Code
# Watch Claude fix issues from structured feedback
```

## 🛠️ How I Built It

### The Meta-Workflow

**This project was built using AI-assisted development practices that it itself enables.**

### Development Process

```
1. Write PRD → Split into 6 milestones
2. Set up Spec Kit → /constitution to define principles
3. For each milestone:
   /specify → Create feature specification
   /clarify → Resolve ambiguities (interactive Q&A)
   /plan    → Generate technical design
   /tasks   → Break design into actionable tasks
   /analyze → Verify cross-artifact consistency
   /implement → Execute task list autonomously
4. Test → Provide feedback → Iterate → Commit
5. Repeat for next milestone
```

### Tools Used

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Claude Code) for 100% of:
- Code implementation
- Test writing
- Design documents
- Architecture decisions

**Custom Slash Commands** (included in repo):
- `/constitution` - Define project principles (guides all decisions)
- `/specify` - Create feature specifications from natural language
- `/clarify` - Ask targeted questions to resolve ambiguities
- `/plan` - Generate technical design documents
- `/tasks` - Break design into dependency-ordered tasks
- `/analyze` - Cross-artifact consistency validation
- `/implement` - Autonomous execution of task list

### Artifacts Created

All included in repository:

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `/docs/roadmap.md` - Milestone breakdown
- `/docs/lore.md` - Raccoon/goat thematic elements
- `CLAUDE.md` - 300+ lines of AI coding context
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines

**Specifications (6 milestones):**
- `/specs/001-cli-parser/` - Diff parsing engine
- `/specs/002-tui-rendering/` - Two-pane TUI
- `/specs/003-commenting/` - Comment system
- `/specs/004-markdown-output/` - Export functionality
- `/specs/005-advanced-interaction/` - Edit/search/help
- `/specs/006-performance-hardening/` - Production hardening

Each spec includes:
- `spec.md` - Feature specification
- `plan.md` - Technical design
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks
- `context-*.md` - Agent context files

**Tests:**
- `tests/contract/` - PRD requirement validation
- `tests/integration/` - End-to-end TUI workflows
- `tests/unit/` - Component/function tests

### Why This Matters

**It's a recursive loop:**
1. Claude builds the tool
2. Tool reviews Claude's work
3. Structured feedback goes back to Claude
4. Claude improves based on review

Every line of code, every test, every design decision was generated by Claude following a structured workflow that the tool itself facilitates.

## 🎯 Impact

RacGoat demonstrates:
1. **AI can build production tools** - Not just prototypes
2. **Structured workflows matter** - /specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /implement
3. **Tools enabling tools** - Meta-loop of AI reviewing AI
4. **Quality at scale** - 100% AI-generated with high quality

The tool I built with Claude now helps me review Claude's work, which I then feed back to Claude to improve. It's turtles all the way down. 🐢🦝🐐

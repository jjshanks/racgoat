## Tips for Good Screenshots

1. **Use a readable terminal theme**
   - Dark background with good contrast
   - Try: Dracula, Nord, Monokai, Solarized Dark

2. **Increase font size**
   - Terminal should be readable in screenshot
   - 14-16pt font recommended

3. **Full window, no desktop**
   - Capture just the terminal window
   - No desktop/taskbar clutter

4. **Terminal size**
   - Make window large enough: 120x40 or bigger
   - App should fit without scrolling

5. **Clean environment**
   - Close unnecessary terminal tabs
   - Clear prompt if it's long/messy

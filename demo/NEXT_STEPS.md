# üéØ Next Steps for Contest Submission

## ‚úÖ Demo Materials Created

Your `/demo` directory now contains:

- ‚úÖ **sample.diff** - Realistic authentication diff for demos
- ‚úÖ **demo.tape** - VHS script for automated GIF creation
- ‚úÖ **run_demo.sh** - Interactive demo generator
- ‚úÖ **CONTEST_SUBMISSION.md** - Polished submission text
- ‚úÖ **README.md** - Demo instructions
- ‚úÖ **SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md** - How to take screenshots
- ‚úÖ **INSTALL_TOOLS.md** - Tool installation guide

## üé¨ Choose Your Demo Method

### Option A: Automated GIF (Best)

**Install VHS:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install vhs

# Linux (requires Go)
go install github.com/charmbracelet/vhs@latest
```

**Generate GIF:**
```bash
cd /home/jjshanks/workspace/racgoat
vhs demo/demo.tape
```

**Output:** `demo/racgoat-demo.gif` (~30-60 seconds)

---

### Option B: Manual Recording

**Install tools:**
```bash
pip install asciinema
cargo install --git https://github.com/asciinema/agg
```

**Record:**
```bash
./demo/run_demo.sh
# Choose option 2
```

---

### Option C: Screenshots (Quickest)

Follow the guide in `demo/SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md`:

1. Run: `cat demo/sample.diff | uv run python -m racgoat -o demo/review.md`
2. Take 5 screenshots:
   - Main TUI view
   - Comment marker
   - Help overlay
   - Search feature
   - Markdown output
3. Save as `01-main-view.png`, `02-comment-marker.png`, etc.

## üìù Update Your Submission

### 1. Test the Demo Manually

Make sure everything works:

```bash
# Test the sample diff
cat demo/sample.diff | uv run python -m racgoat -o demo/review.md

# Navigate, add comments, search, show help, quit
# Then check the output:
cat demo/review.md
```

### 2. Add Visuals to README

Once you have your GIF or screenshots:

**For GIF:**
```markdown
## üé¨ Demo

![RacGoat Demo](demo/racgoat-demo.gif)
```

**For screenshots:**
```markdown
## üé¨ Screenshots

### Two-Pane TUI
![Main View](demo/01-main-view.png)

### Help Overlay
![Help](demo/03-help-overlay.png)

### Markdown Output
![Output](demo/05-markdown-output.png)
```

Add this section near the top of your main `README.md`.

### 3. Update Contest Submission

Use the text from `demo/CONTEST_SUBMISSION.md`:

**Where to post:** Discord #share-your-project (by October 7)

**Required info:**
- ‚úÖ How you built it (slash commands, Claude Code workflow)
- ‚úÖ Screenshots or demos (GIF/screenshots/video)
- ‚úÖ Must be your own work, built with Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Template ready:** Copy from `demo/CONTEST_SUBMISSION.md`

### 4. Add Missing Elements

**GitHub repo URL:**
- Replace `[Add your repo URL]` in CONTEST_SUBMISSION.md
- Make sure repo is public

**Badge (optional):**
Add to top of README.md:
```markdown
[![Built with Claude](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Claude%20Sonnet%204.5-5A67D8)](https://claude.ai)
```

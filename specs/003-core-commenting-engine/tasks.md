# Tasks: Core Commenting Engine

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/jjshanks/workspace/racgoat/specs/003-core-commenting-engine/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Python 3.12+, Textual >=6.2.0, pytest >=8.4.2
   → Structure: Single project (racgoat/ source, tests/)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Comment, CommentTarget, ApplicationMode, CommentMarker
   → contracts/: comment-store-api.md, ui-interactions.md
   → research.md: Modal interaction patterns, storage patterns
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: No new dependencies needed (all existing)
   → Tests: 13 contract tests (already created), 10 integration tests
   → Core: Models (4), Services (1), UI widgets (StatusBar + modifications)
   → Integration: Wire commenting system into RacGoatApp
   → Polish: Performance validation, quickstart verification
4. Task rules applied:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file modifications = sequential
   → Tests before implementation (TDD - contract tests already exist and FAIL)
5. Tasks numbered T001-T035
6. Dependencies tracked in section below
7. Parallel execution examples provided
```

## Dependencies

**Phase Dependencies**:
- Phase 3.1 (baseline) → Phase 3.3 (models)
- Phase 3.3 (models) → Phase 3.4 (service layer)
- Phase 3.4 (service layer) → Phase 3.5-3.8 (UI layer)
- Phase 3.8 (integration) → Phase 3.9 (integration tests)
- Phase 3.9 (integration tests) → Phase 3.10 (polish)

**Specific Task Dependencies**:
- T001 blocks T002-T006 (must verify baseline first)
- T002-T006 block T007 (models must exist before service)
- T007 blocks T008-T018 (skeleton must exist before methods)
- T008-T012 are sequential (add() implementation builds incrementally)
- T013-T018 can run parallel after T012 (independent utility methods)
- T019 requires T008-T018 complete (verify all contract tests pass)
- T020-T022 can run parallel with T023-T029 (different files)
- T023-T027 are sequential (same file: diff_pane.py), T024a follows T024
- T028-T029 are sequential (same file: files_pane.py)
- T030-T034 are sequential (same file: main.py)
- T035-T044 can ALL run in parallel (different test files)
- T045-T049 are sequential (validation phase)

**Critical Path**:
T001 → T002-T006 → T007 → T008-T012 → T019 → T023-T034 → T035-T044 → T045-T049

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.3: Models (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T002-T006 together (different models/files):
Task: "Create Comment model in racgoat/models/comments.py"
Task: "Create CommentTarget model in racgoat/models/comments.py"
Task: "Create CommentType enum in racgoat/models/comments.py"
Task: "Add ApplicationMode enum to racgoat/ui/models.py"
Task: "Create CommentMarker UI model in racgoat/ui/models.py"
```

### Phase 3.4: Service Utilities (After Core Implementation)
```bash

Task: "Implement CommentStore.delete() method"
Task: "Implement CommentStore.has_comment() utility"
Task: "Implement CommentStore.get_file_comments() utility"
Task: "Implement CommentStore.count() method"
Task: "Implement CommentStore.clear() method"
```

### Phase 3.9: Integration Tests (All Parallel)

Task: "Write test_single_line_comment.py"
Task: "Write test_file_level_comment.py"
Task: "Write test_range_selection.py"
Task: "Write test_visual_markers.py"
Task: "Write test_status_bar.py"

Task: "Write test_overlapping_comments.py"
Task: "Write test_cancel_scenarios.py"
Task: "Write test_select_mode_lock.py"
Task: "Write test_performance.py"
```

## Notes

### TDD Approach
- Contract tests already exist and are FAILING (red phase complete)
- Phase 3.4 implements CommentStore incrementally to make tests pass (green phase)
- T019 is explicit gate: all contract tests must pass before proceeding

### File Modification Tracking
- **Models**: racgoat/models/comments.py (T002-T004), racgoat/ui/models.py (T005-T006)
- **Service**: racgoat/services/comment_store.py (T007-T018)
- **Widgets**: racgoat/ui/widgets/status_bar.py (T020-T022), diff_pane.py (T023-T027), files_pane.py (T028-T029)
- **App**: racgoat/main.py (T030-T034)
- **Tests**: tests/integration/test_milestone3/ (T035-T044)

### Parallelization Strategy
- Same file modifications are sequential (e.g., T023-T027 all modify diff_pane.py)
- Different files can run in parallel (marked with [P])
- Independent utility methods can run in parallel (T013-T018)
- All integration tests can run in parallel (T035-T044)

### Constitution Compliance
- **Fun Is a Feature**: Comment function names follow raccoon/goat theme (verified in research.md)
- **TUI-First**: All interactions keyboard-driven (verified in contracts/)
- **TDD**: Contract tests exist and fail, implementation follows (T008-T019)
- **Performance**: 100 comment capacity, <50ms response (validated in T047)
- **Data Integrity**: Exact line numbers preserved (CommentTarget model)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Cancel scenarios tested (T042)

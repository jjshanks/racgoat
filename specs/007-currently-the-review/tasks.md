# Tasks: Include Diff Segments in Review Output

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-currently-the-review/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature follows TDD approach - contract tests are written FIRST to validate functional requirements.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project structure**: `racgoat/` for source, `tests/` at repository root
- Follows existing RacGoat architecture from Milestones 1-7

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Test Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare test files and fixtures for TDD workflow

- [X] T001 [P] Create contract test file `tests/contract/test_diff_segments.py` with base fixtures (sample_diff_file, sample_review_session)
- [X] T002 [P] Create performance test file `tests/integration/test_performance/test_diff_segment_performance.py` with setup
- [X] T003 Verify existing test suite baseline (run `uv run pytest tests/` - expect 98 tests passing)

**Checkpoint**: Test infrastructure ready for TDD workflow - COMPLETE

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Core Function Implementation)

**Purpose**: Implement core diff segment extraction functions that all user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: These functions must be implemented before any user story can be completed

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - File-level Comments with Statistical Summary (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Display statistical summary (hunk count and line changes) for file-level comments instead of detailed diff context

**Independent Test**: Add a file-level comment, verify output includes "N hunks, +X -Y lines" statistical summary

### Contract Tests for User Story 3 (Written FIRST - Red Phase)

- [X] T036 [P] [US3] Write contract test `test_file_comment_shows_statistical_summary()` in `tests/contract/test_diff_segments.py` (FR-006)

### Implementation for User Story 3

**Checkpoint**: Edge cases handled - feature is hardened

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Performance validation, regression checks, and final validation

### Performance Validation

- [X] T045 Implement performance test `test_diff_segment_extraction_performance()` in `tests/integration/test_performance/test_diff_segment_performance.py` (validate <100ms for 100 comments - SC-004)

- [X] T051 Fix any test failures related to output format changes (update test expectations if needed)

### Manual Validation

- [X] T052 Generate sample review with `git diff HEAD~1 | uv run python -m racgoat -o review.md` and verify output quality (SC-007)
- [X] T053 Compare before/after review.md outputs - confirm diff segments provide clearer context than line numbers

**Checkpoint**: Feature complete and validated

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if multiple developers)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Edge Cases (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all phases complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 (both modify same function but different branches)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2 (separate code path in serialize function)

### Within Each User Story

- Contract tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD red phase)
- Core implementation before running tests (green phase)
- Integration tests after contract tests pass
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: All 3 tasks can run in parallel (different files)
- Phase 2 Tests (T004-T015): All 12 unit tests can be written in parallel (same file, but independent test functions)
- Phase 3 Contract Tests (T019-T025): All 7 tests can be written in parallel
- Phase 6 Contract Tests (T041-T043): All 3 tests can be written in parallel
- **User Stories**: Once Foundational phase completes, all three user stories (Phases 3, 4, 5) can be worked on in parallel by different developers

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase Unit Tests

```bash
# Write all 12 unit tests in parallel (different developers or concurrent edits):
Task: "test_extract_diff_segment_line_comment() in tests/unit/test_markdown_writer.py"
Task: "test_extract_diff_segment_range_comment() in tests/unit/test_markdown_writer.py"
Task: "test_extract_diff_segment_file_comment_returns_none() in tests/unit/test_markdown_writer.py"
# ... (9 more tests)
```

## Parallel Example: User Stories (If Team Has Multiple Developers)

```bash
# After Phase 2 completes, launch user stories in parallel:
Developer A: Phase 3 (User Story 1) - Line comments
Developer B: Phase 4 (User Story 2) - Range comments
Developer C: Phase 5 (User Story 3) - File comments
# Each developer works independently on separate branches of serialize_review_session()
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T018) - CRITICAL blocking phase
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T029)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test line comments independently with sample diff
5. Deploy/demo MVP with just line comment support

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Core functions ready (T001-T018)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo MVP (T019-T029)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T030-T035)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T036-T040)
5. Add Edge Cases ‚Üí Harden (T041-T044)
6. Polish & Validate ‚Üí Final release (T045-T053)

### Parallel Team Strategy (If Multiple Developers Available)

With 3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T018)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (line comments) - T019-T029
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (range comments) - T030-T035
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (file comments) - T036-T040
3. Developers merge in priority order (US1 first, then US2, then US3)
4. Team completes Edge Cases + Polish together (T041-T053)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent test functions, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3) for traceability
- [FOUNDATION] label indicates blocking prerequisite for all user stories
- TDD workflow: Write tests FIRST (red) ‚Üí Implement (green) ‚Üí Verify (green stays green)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable

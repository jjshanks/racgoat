# Feature Specification: Advanced Interaction & Usability

**Feature Branch**: `005-advanced-interaction-usability`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Advanced Interaction & Usability
**Goal**: Enhance the user experience with advanced features that make the review process more efficient.

**Tasks**:
    * Implement the comment **edit/delete** functionality (`e`).
    * Implement **search functionality** (`/`) within the diff view.
    * Create a **help overlay** (`?`) that displays all keybindings.

**Deliverable**: A feature-complete application that matches all interactive requirements from the PRD."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: When a user presses `e` on a line with no existing comment, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Silently do nothing; `e` keybinding should only be displayed/enabled when there is a comment to edit
- Q: When a user searches for a pattern that doesn't exist in the current diff, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show "0/0 matches" counter in the status bar
- Q: When a user has search results highlighted and switches to a different file, what should happen to the search state? ‚Üí A: Search state resets completely - clear query and highlights
- Q: What type of search pattern matching should be supported? ‚Üí A: Literal string only, case-sensitive
- Q: When exiting search mode with `Esc`, what should happen to the search highlights? ‚Üí A: Clear all highlights immediately

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a code reviewer using RacGoat, I need to efficiently manage my review workflow with advanced interaction features. When I've added a comment and realize it needs modification, I should be able to edit it without having to delete and recreate it. When reviewing large diffs, I need to quickly find specific code patterns or keywords without manually scrolling. When I forget a keyboard shortcut, I should be able to view a comprehensive help overlay without leaving the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing a diff with an existing comment on line 42, **When** I navigate to that line and press `e`, **Then** I should see an edit dialog pre-populated with the existing comment text where I can modify it

2. **Given** I am viewing a diff with an existing comment on line 15, **When** I navigate to that line and press `e` followed by deleting all text and confirming, **Then** the comment should be removed from that line and the visual marker should disappear

3. **Given** I am viewing a diff pane with focus, **When** I press `/`, **Then** a search input field should appear allowing me to enter a search query

4. **Given** I have entered a search query "TODO", **When** I press Enter, **Then** the diff pane should highlight all matches and jump to the first occurrence

5. **Given** I have multiple search matches visible, **When** I press `n`, **Then** the view should jump to the next match in sequence

6. **Given** I have multiple search matches visible, **When** I press `N`, **Then** the view should jump to the previous match in sequence

7. **Given** I am in any screen of the application, **When** I press `?`, **Then** a help overlay should appear displaying all available keybindings organized by context

8. **Given** the help overlay is displayed, **When** I press `?` or `Esc`, **Then** the help overlay should close and return me to my previous context

9. **Given** I am editing a range comment spanning lines 10-15, **When** I press `e` while on any line in that range, **Then** I should be able to edit the range comment

10. **Given** I have a file-level comment on a file, **When** I press `e` while viewing that file, **Then** I should be able to edit the file-level comment

### Edge Cases

- Pressing `e` on a line with no comments does nothing (keybinding only shown when comment exists)
- Search for non-existent pattern shows "0/0 matches" counter in status bar
- Switching to a different file resets search state completely (clears query and highlights)
- How does the search interact with very long lines that are truncated in the display?
- What happens when I edit a comment to empty text? Is that the same as deleting it?
- What happens when I press `e` while in Select Mode for a range comment?
- What happens when the help overlay is taller than the terminal window?
- What happens when search wraps around from the last match to the first?

## Requirements

### Key Entities

- **EditableComment**: Represents any existing comment (line, range, or file-level) that can be modified or deleted by the user
- **SearchQuery**: Represents the user's search input and associated match state (pattern, current match index, total matches)
- **SearchMatch**: Represents a single occurrence of the search pattern within the diff text (line number, character offset, matched text)
- **HelpEntry**: Represents a single keybinding in the help overlay (key, action, description, context category)

# Feature Specification: Performance Hardening & Final Polish

**Feature Branch**: `006-performance-hardening-final`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Performance Hardening & Final Polish
**Goal**: Ensure the application is robust, performant, and reliable, especially when handling large-scale code changes.

**Tasks**:
    * Implement **lazy loading** and **viewport rendering** to meet the 100 files / 10,000 lines performance requirement.
    * Benchmark the application against large, real-world diffs.
    * Add robust error handling for malformed diff inputs.
    * Refine all UI elements and help text for clarity and consistency.
    * **Resolve Milestone 1 test regression**: Rewrite obsolete binary filtering tests (`tests/contract/test_binary_filtering.py`) as TUI tests verifying binary files are excluded from file list.

**Deliverable**: A production-ready, performant, and stable **v1** of the AI Code Review TUI."

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: When a diff contains both valid hunks and malformed hunks (FR-011: "continue functioning"), what should happen to the malformed hunks? → A: Display malformed hunks as raw text (unparsed) with a visual indicator marking them as unparseable
- Q: The test regression (FR-020) mentions three options for handling binary filtering tests. Which approach should be taken? → A: Rewrite as TUI tests verifying binary files are excluded from file list
- Q: How should the system handle memory constraints when loading extremely large diffs (e.g., 50,000+ lines)? → A: Hard limit at 10,000 lines - reject any diff exceeding this size with error message
- Q: FR-013 requires demonstrating performance metrics (load time, latency, etc.). How should these metrics be captured and reported? → A: Test suite assertions validating performance benchmarks (automated performance tests)
- Q: When file I/O errors occur during review output (FR-010: "handle with clear error messages"), what should the error recovery behavior be? → A: Handle the same way as when file already exists

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer reviewing AI-generated code changes, I need the TUI to handle large-scale diffs (100+ files, 10,000+ lines) without performance degradation or crashes, so I can efficiently review complex pull requests and refactoring operations. The application must gracefully handle malformed or corrupted diff inputs and provide clear, consistent UI feedback throughout the review process.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a diff containing 100 files with 10,000 total lines, **When** the user launches the application, **Then** the TUI renders within 2 seconds and remains responsive with all interactions (scrolling, navigation, commenting) completing in under 200ms.

2. **Given** a diff file with missing headers or invalid hunk syntax, **When** the user attempts to load it, **Then** the application displays a clear error message explaining the parsing failure without crashing, and allows the user to exit gracefully.

3. **Given** the user is reviewing a diff with 1,000+ lines in a single file, **When** scrolling through the diff pane, **Then** only visible content is rendered (viewport rendering), maintaining smooth scrolling performance under 100ms per scroll action.

4. **Given** a diff containing only binary files, **When** the application launches, **Then** the files pane shows an appropriate message indicating no reviewable files are available, and the test suite accurately validates this behavior without expecting immediate application exit.

5. **Given** the user encounters help text, status messages, or UI labels, **When** reading them, **Then** all text is clear, grammatically correct, consistent in tone, and follows the raccoon/goat theme where appropriate.

6. **Given** a diff exceeding 10,000 total lines, **When** the user attempts to load it, **Then** the application rejects the diff with a clear error message explaining the size limit and exits gracefully.

### Edge Cases

- How does viewport rendering handle rapid scrolling through thousands of lines?
- What happens when a diff contains Unicode characters, emoji, or unusual line endings?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Performance Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST render and display diffs containing up to 100 files without exceeding 2 seconds initial load time.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support diffs with up to 10,000 total lines across all files without performance degradation.
- **FR-002a**: System MUST reject diffs exceeding 10,000 total lines with a clear error message explaining the size limit.
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement viewport-based rendering so only visible content is processed for display at any given time.
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain UI responsiveness with all user interactions (key presses, scrolling, navigation) completing in under 200ms for supported file sizes.
- **FR-005**: System MUST lazy-load file content so files not currently selected do not consume rendering resources.

#### Error Handling Requirements
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect and report malformed diff headers (missing file paths, invalid git diff markers).
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect and report invalid hunk syntax (malformed line ranges, missing content).
- **FR-008**: System MUST display user-friendly error messages for parsing failures that explain the issue location and nature.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow graceful exit when encountering parsing errors, without data loss of any comments created before the error.
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle file I/O errors (permissions, disk full) during review output using the same error recovery mechanism as existing file conflicts (error recovery modal).
- **FR-011**: System MUST continue functioning when encountering individual malformed hunks within an otherwise valid diff by displaying malformed hunks as raw text with a visual indicator marking them as unparseable.

#### Benchmarking & Validation Requirements
- **FR-012**: System MUST be tested against real-world diff samples including large refactorings, dependency updates, and code generation outputs.
- **FR-013**: System MUST demonstrate performance metrics through automated performance tests that validate: initial load time, file switching latency, scroll responsiveness, and comment addition latency across various diff sizes.
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate correct behavior with edge case diffs: empty files, binary files, extremely long lines (>2000 chars), and diffs with no changes.

#### UI Consistency & Clarity Requirements
- **FR-015**: System MUST display consistent help text across all help overlays, status messages, and documentation.
- **FR-016**: System MUST use consistent keybinding descriptions (e.g., always "Ctrl+X" not mixed "^X" or "Control-X").
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide clear status bar context for all application modes (normal, search, select, comment entry).
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain visual consistency in color schemes, spacing, and widget alignment across all panes.
- **FR-019**: System MUST ensure all user-facing text follows proper grammar, spelling, and the established raccoon/goat thematic tone.

#### Test Suite Requirements
- **FR-020**: System MUST resolve test regression by rewriting binary filtering tests as TUI tests that verify binary files are excluded from the reviewable file list.
- **FR-021**: System MUST validate that binary files are excluded from the reviewable file list in the TUI.
- **FR-022**: System MUST maintain comprehensive test coverage including performance tests, error handling tests, and edge case tests.
- **FR-023**: System MUST have all existing tests passing before v1 release.

### Key Entities

- **Viewport**: The visible portion of a diff or file list displayed to the user at any given time, representing a subset of total content to optimize rendering performance.

- **Performance Benchmark**: A recorded measurement of system behavior (load time, response latency, memory usage) under specific conditions (diff size, file count, operation type).

- **Error Report**: A user-facing message describing a parsing or system failure, including error type, location (file/line if applicable), and suggested user action.

- **UI Component**: Any text element, widget label, help text, or status message visible to users, subject to consistency and clarity requirements.

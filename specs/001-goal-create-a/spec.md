# Feature Specification: CLI Git Diff Processor & Summary Generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-goal-create-a`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented (100% test coverage, 124/124 tests passing)
**Input**: User description: "**Goal**: Create a non-visual command-line tool that successfully ingests, parses, and summarizes a `git diff`. This validates the entire data input and processing pipeline without any UI complexity.

**Tasks**:
    * Implement logic to read a `git diff` from `stdin`.
    * Parse the diff data to identify changed files and count their added/removed lines.
    * Filter and skip binary, non-text, and specified generated files (e.g., `.lock`, `.min.js`).
    * Implement command-line argument parsing for the `-o <filename>` flag.
    * For this milestone, the tool's output will be a **simple text summary written to a file** (e.g., `path/to/file.py: +10 -5`). The output filename should be controllable via the `-o` flag.
    * Handle the edge case of an empty diff.

**Deliverable**: A runnable CLI that processes a diff and writes a summary of changed files and line counts to an output file."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: Should the tool filter additional common generated file patterns beyond `.lock` and `.min.js`? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive: All frontend patterns (`.lock`, `.min.js`, `.map`, `.bundle.js`) + package managers (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `poetry.lock`) + `.min.css`, `*.generated.*`, `dist/`, `build/` directories
- Q: What should the default output filename be when the `-o` flag is not provided? ‚Üí A: `review.md` (Markdown format, aligns with future review features)
- Q: What should the output be when the diff is empty (no changes)? ‚Üí A: Skip file creation entirely (no output file)
- Q: What exit codes should the tool use for different outcomes? ‚Üí A: 0 for success (including empty diff), 1 for all failures
- Q: How should the tool handle invalid command-line arguments? ‚Üí A: Print error + usage help, exit code 1

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to quickly understand the scope and impact of code changes in a git diff without manually reviewing each file. They pipe a git diff through the CLI tool, which reads the changes, filters out non-reviewable files (binary files, generated files like lockfiles and minified code), and produces a concise summary showing each changed file with line addition and deletion counts written to an output file.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a git diff with 5 modified text files on stdin, **When** the user runs the tool with `-o summary.txt`, **Then** the tool writes a summary file containing each file path with its line change counts (e.g., `src/main.py: +15 -3`)
2. **Given** a git diff containing both text files and binary files, **When** the tool processes the diff, **Then** the summary includes only text files and excludes binary files
3. **Given** a git diff with generated files (.lock, .min.js), **When** the tool processes the diff, **Then** the summary excludes these filtered files
4. **Given** an empty diff on stdin, **When** the tool runs, **Then** it handles the empty input gracefully and produces an appropriate output
5. **Given** no `-o` flag is provided, **When** the tool runs, **Then** it uses a default output filename for the summary

### Edge Cases
- What happens when stdin contains no data (empty diff)? ‚Üí No output file is created, exits with code 0
- What happens when the specified output file path is invalid or unwritable? ‚Üí Tool exits with code 1 (failure)
- What happens when a diff contains only binary or filtered files (resulting in no files to summarize)? ‚Üí Treated as empty diff; no output file is created, exits with code 0
- What happens when the diff format is malformed or corrupted? ‚Üí Tool exits with code 1 (failure)
- What happens when file paths in the diff contain special characters or spaces? ‚Üí Paths are preserved as-is in output
- What happens when invalid command-line arguments are provided? ‚Üí Tool prints error message + usage help to stderr, exits with code 1

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST read git diff data from stdin
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse diff data to identify all changed files
- **FR-003**: System MUST count added lines for each changed file
- **FR-004**: System MUST count removed lines for each changed file
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify and skip binary files in the diff
- **FR-006**: System MUST identify and skip generated files matching these patterns: `.lock`, `.min.js`, `.min.css`, `.map`, `.bundle.js`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `*.generated.*`, and files within `dist/` or `build/` directories (all patterns are case-sensitive, matching git diff output exactly)
- **FR-007**: System MUST accept a `-o <filename>` command-line argument to specify the output file path
- **FR-007a**: System MUST validate command-line arguments and, when invalid arguments are detected (e.g., `-o` without filename, unknown flags), print an error message followed by usage help to stderr and exit with code 1
- **FR-008**: System MUST write summary output to the file specified by `-o` flag
- **FR-009**: System MUST use `review.md` as the default output filename when `-o` flag is not provided
- **FR-010**: System MUST format each summary line as `path/to/file: +X -Y` where X is added lines and Y is removed lines
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle empty diff input without error and skip output file creation when no changes are present
- **FR-012**: System MUST exit with status code 0 for successful processing (including empty diff handled gracefully) and status code 1 for any failure condition

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Git Diff**: Raw text input from stdin containing unified diff format with file headers, hunks, and line changes
- **Changed File**: Represents a single file in the diff with its path, added line count, and removed line count
- **Summary Output**: Text file containing one line per changed file, showing file path and change statistics
- **File Filter Rule**: Pattern or criterion for excluding files (binary indicator, file extension patterns for generated files)

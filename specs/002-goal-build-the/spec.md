# Feature Specification: TUI Rendering & Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `002-goal-build-the`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "**Goal**: Build the read-only visual interface. This milestone takes the parsed data structure from Milestone 1 and renders it in an interactive TUI.

**Tasks**:
    * Build the basic two-pane TUI layout: a **Files Pane** on the left and a **Diff Pane** on the right.
    * Populate the file list using the parsed diff data.
    * Render the selected file's diff hunks in the Diff Pane with correct **ANSI color highlighting** and post-change line numbers.
    * Implement navigation: `arrow keys` to move within a pane and `Tab` to switch focus.
    * Implement the `q` key to quit the application.
    * Display a "No diff" message if the input was empty.

**Deliverable**: A read-only TUI diff viewer. Invoking the tool now opens the visual interface instead of writing a summary file."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: When the application launches with a valid diff, which pane should receive initial focus? ‚Üí A: Diff Pane (right) - shows content of first file immediately
- Q: What is the maximum number of files and total diff lines this milestone must handle without performance degradation? ‚Üí A: 20 files / 2k lines (reasonable for Milestone 2)
- Q: When a very long file name exceeds the Files Pane width, how should it be displayed? ‚Üí A: Truncate middle (e.g., "src/.../path/file.py")
- Q: What data format does Milestone 1's parser output for consumption by this TUI? ‚Üí A: Python data structure (dict/list) in memory
- Q: When the git diff contains only one file, should the Files Pane still be displayed? ‚Üí A: Yes - maintain two-pane layout consistently

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a code reviewer, I want to visually navigate through a git diff in a terminal interface so that I can view changed files and their diff hunks without leaving the command line. The interface should provide a split-pane view where I can select files from a list on the left and see the corresponding diff content with syntax highlighting on the right.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a git diff with multiple changed files, **When** the application launches, **Then** the user sees a two-pane layout with a file list on the left and diff content on the right, with the first file auto-selected, its diff displayed, and focus on the Diff Pane
2. **Given** the file list is populated, **When** the user navigates with arrow keys, **Then** the selection moves between files and the diff pane updates to show the selected file's changes
3. **Given** a file is selected, **When** the diff is displayed, **Then** line numbers reflect the post-change state with appropriate +/- prefixes and syntax highlighting
4. **Given** the user is in one pane, **When** they press Tab, **Then** focus switches to the other pane
5. **Given** the user is viewing the diff, **When** they press 'q', **Then** the application exits cleanly
6. **Given** an empty git diff is provided, **When** the application launches, **Then** a "No diff" message is displayed instead of empty panes

### Edge Cases
- When the git diff contains only one file, the two-pane layout must be maintained consistently (Files Pane shows the single file, Diff Pane shows its content)
- File names that exceed the Files Pane width must be truncated in the middle, preserving the beginning and end of the path (e.g., "src/.../path/file.py")
- How does navigation behave when there are no files in the list?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a two-pane layout with a Files Pane on the left and a Diff Pane on the right
- **FR-002**: System MUST populate the Files Pane with the list of changed files from the parsed git diff data
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the selected file's diff hunks in the Diff Pane with ANSI color highlighting
- **FR-004**: System MUST show post-change line numbers in the diff display with +/- prefixes indicating additions and deletions
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to navigate within a pane using arrow keys (up/down for file list, up/down for scrolling diff content)
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to switch focus between panes using the Tab key
- **FR-007**: System MUST update the Diff Pane content when a different file is selected in the Files Pane
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to quit the application by pressing the 'q' key
- **FR-009**: System MUST display a "No diff" message when the input git diff is empty
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain a read-only view (no editing or commenting in this milestone)
- **FR-011**: System MUST filter out binary and generated files from the file list (as established in Milestone 1: .lock files, .min.js files, etc.)
- **FR-012**: System MUST indicate which pane currently has focus through visual feedback
- **FR-013**: On launch with valid diff data, system MUST auto-select the first file, display its diff content, and set initial focus to the Diff Pane
- **FR-014**: System MUST truncate file paths that exceed the Files Pane width by removing middle path segments and replacing with "...", preserving the beginning and end of the path
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain the two-pane layout regardless of the number of files (including when only one file is present in the diff)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST render the UI and respond to navigation input without noticeable lag for diffs containing up to 20 files and 2,000 total diff lines
- **NFR-002**: UI updates (pane switching, file selection, scrolling) MUST feel instantaneous to the user (‚â§100ms response time)

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- **DEP-001**: This milestone depends on Milestone 1's parser, which provides parsed diff data as Python data structures (dictionaries and lists) in memory
- **ASSUME-001**: The parser provides a list of file entries, where each entry contains the file path and a list of diff hunks with line numbers and content

### Key Entities
- **File Entry**: Represents a single changed file in the diff, containing the file path, change summary (lines added/removed), and associated diff hunks
- **Diff Hunk**: Represents a contiguous block of changes within a file, containing line numbers, change type (addition/deletion/context), and the actual line content
- **Pane Focus State**: Indicates which pane (Files or Diff) is currently active and receiving keyboard input

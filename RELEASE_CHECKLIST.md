2. **Verify trusted publishing setup**:
   - Environment name matches (`pypi`)
   - Repository and workflow names are correct
3. **Check PyPI project name** isn't already taken
4. **Verify package metadata** is valid (run `uv build` locally first)

### If tests fail in CI:

1. **Run tests locally** to reproduce
2. **Check for environment-specific issues** (Windows/macOS vs Linux)
3. **Fix issues and create a new patch release** (v1.0.1)

### If installation from PyPI fails:

   ```bash
   # Download and inspect
   pip download racgoat
   tar -tzf racgoat-1.0.0.tar.gz | head -20
   ```
2. **Check dependency versions** in pyproject.toml

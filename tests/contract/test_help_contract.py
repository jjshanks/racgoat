"""Contract tests for help overlay functionality (Milestone 5).

These tests define the expected behavior for the help overlay.

Tests verify:
- '?' key displays help overlay
- Help shows keybindings organized by context
- Help dismissible with '?' or Esc
- Help scrollable when content exceeds terminal height
- Help accessible from any screen

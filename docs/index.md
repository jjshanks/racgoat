# RacGoat Documentation

## Where Code Gets 'Goated'! 🦝🐐

Welcome to the official RacGoat documentation - your guide to building TUI applications with the mischief of a raccoon and the determination of a mountain goat!

---

## What is RacGoat?

RacGoat is a Python TUI (Text User Interface) application built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/). It combines:

- 🦝 **Raccoon Energy**: Clever, resourceful, and always finding the best solutions (usually in garbage bins)
- 🐐 **Goat Determination**: Stubborn, persistent, and always climbing to new heights

Together, they make the perfect development duo!

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (UV handles everything!)
uv sync

# Run the app
uv run python -m racgoat
```

---

## Features

### Current Features
- Beautiful TUI interface with Textual
- Themed utility functions (because regular functions are boring)
- Comprehensive test suite (that also tells jokes)
- Hidden easter eggs (try typing "trash" in the app 👀)

### Planned Features
- More raccoon-themed commands
- Goat-level achievement system
- ASCII art gallery
- Trash bin data structures (for real though)

## Philosophy

RacGoat follows these core principles:

1. **Code should be fun**: If you're not enjoying it, you're doing it wrong
2. **Tests should make you smile**: Life's too short for boring test names
3. **Comments should have personality**: Your future self will thank you
4. **Easter eggs are mandatory**: Always hide surprises for the curious

## Contributing

Want to contribute? Great! Here's how:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/more-raccoon-puns`)
3. Make your changes (add more animal puns, we dare you)
4. Write tests (make them funny!)
5. Submit a PR

Just remember: Don't be a scapegoat - ask for help if you need it! 🐐

## Easter Eggs 🥚

There are easter eggs hidden throughout the codebase. We won't tell you where they all are (that would ruin the fun!), but here's a hint:

- One involves typing a certain word in the TUI... 🦝
- Another is hidden in the test suite comments... 👀
- There might be wisdom hidden in the `__init__.py`... 🧙

Happy hunting!
